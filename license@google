I'm not familiar with a "Google FreeBASIC" license. FreeBASIC is an open-source compiler, and its runtime library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), while the compiler itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Could you be thinking of something else, or perhaps a specific project that uses FreeBASIC with a different license?
