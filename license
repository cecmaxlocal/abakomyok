The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It allows users to do anything they want with the software, as long as they include the original copyright and license notice.

Here's a breakdown of its key features:

*   **Permissive:** It places very few restrictions on reuse.
*   **Commercial Use:** Software under the MIT license can be used in proprietary software (software that is not open source).
*   **Modification and Distribution:** You can modify the software and distribute those modifications.
*   **No Warranty:** The license explicitly states that the software is provided "as is," without any warranty.

**FreeBASIC** is a free/open source (GPL) BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, DOS and Linux. It aims to be syntax compatible with QuickBASIC, but also extends the language with modern features. Given that FreeBASIC itself is GPL, if you were to develop a project using FreeBASIC, your project would typically also be under the GPL or a compatible license if you link against GPL-licensed libraries or components.

While you could theoretically release your *own* FreeBASIC code under the MIT license (as long as it doesn't incorporate or derive significantly from GPL-licensed FreeBASIC source code in a way that would trigger GPL's viral clause), the FreeBASIC *compiler itself* is GPL. This means that if you distribute a program compiled with FreeBASIC, the GPL doesn't directly apply to your program's source code, but rather to the compiler you used.

Here's an example of what an MIT license typically looks like:

```

Would you like me to generate an image related to open-source software, a license document, or perhaps a computer running FreeBASIC?
